    "text": "Caiya Coggshall is a senior at Harvey Mudd College finishing a Bachelor of Science in General Engineering with a focus in mechanical and manufacturing. Her academic background spans mechanical design, microprocessor systems, systems engineering, and electrical & magnetic circuits providing a strong foundation in both analytical and hands-on problem solving.\nCurrently she’s the team lead for a project at Chinabridge Medical (CBM) Lifemotion that involves the design, manufacturing, and testing of a medical device to support cannulation for Extracorpoeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). On campus, she serves as a machine shop proctor, training students in milling, lathe operation, and various other tooling machines. Lastly, she leads as the external operations coordinator of the tours program at Harvey Mudd College.\n​Some of her past experience involves fabricating and testing fixtures to support the development of a Class III medical device as a manufacturing engineering intern at E2 - Endovascular Engineering. She’s alsp prototyped a fully mechanical autoinjector for hormonal acne treatment through Indomo. In research, she managed a cell culture facility and contributed to experimental systems for cancer and nanoparticle drug delivery.\nShe’s drawn to projects that build real, physical systems and approach every problem with curiosity, attention to detail, and a drive to make things that actually work."
